What is a HashMap
O notation
Standard questions on array traversal to find maximum subsequence sum, 3 sum,
Count the occurrence of a set of words in a character stream
Finding unique words in a string
Swap two digits from an integer, the result should be the maximum. For example 3580 -> 8350
Count number of islands in a matrix.  
Given an array of words as NSStrings you should return another array of NSStrings, each containing words that are mutual anagrams

 You have a list of words and a list of hotel reviews, try to sort the hotels based on the number of words from the first list that is exist in the each review. if an hotel has maximum number of 4 words then it should be the highest in the sorting..  

 You have time-stamps (mentioned as integers), which represents phone call begin and end to booking.com call center. find the number of overlaps in calls that suggests to add more call center agents.

You have two lists, the first contain larger words, write a method that finds if the anagram from the second list's word in the first list's word.

calculate the complexity of the previous function. They gave me hints and later they considered my answer as weak.  

We have a log file, can grow pretty big. Each line is a  trace-log, and the first field is the RequestID.
001 <timestamp> BEGIN
001 <timestamp> fetched from db
001 <timestamp> some processing ..
002 <timestamp> BEGIN ..
002 <timestamp> fetched from db
001 <timestamp> returned success
003 <timestamp> BEGIN
001 <timestamp> END
003 <timestamp> some work
002 <timestamp> ERROR
003 <timestamp> some other work…

Stack implementation (thread safe)  
Lifecycle of views and windows for iOS. View Controller management etc

Question with using NSDictionary, NSString, NSArray, Class init, NSNumbers.

On 1st step there were several complicated questions about Coredata, concurrency, generating getters and setters, and so on. I completed everything greatly.
On 2nd step there was an obvious question about simple UITableView and I got confused. I was expecting in-depth questions about memory management, more concurrency, runtime stuff and so on

Make basic UITableView, implement json-to-object mapping, table delegate and datasource, wiith async image load  


photoshop has a function fill color that will fill color inside a given shape.
You need to write a method that fill color. This method takes 2d array, coordiates x, y from where it will start filling the color inside whole shape. If any of the coordiante is already filled with color, leave it and move ahead.

fill_color(int arr[][], int x, int y)

what we would like to improve on the App
Searching for a word in a list of words.

Given an array of integers and integer K, return another array holding integers appeared K times in the given array  

1. Given a 3 array like below

NSArray *a = [1,3,4,5];
NSArray *b = [-1,3,0,9];
NSArray *c = [0,31,32,22,6];

Find the elements from the three array which existing in atleast 2 arrays.
Eg: [3, 0]


//[“Raymond”, “Nora”, “Daniel”, “Louie”, “Peter”, “Esteban”]
//Output: [“Peter”, “Raymond”, “Daniel”, “Louie”, “Esteban”, “Nora”]
